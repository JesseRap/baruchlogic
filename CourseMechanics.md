# PHI 1600 - Course Notes

<h2>The Main Components</h2>

The course materials consist of the following components:
* A [textbook](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Du0ACARlaeZqEhM6JdWHH0nffNSCYDAZ?usp=sharing)
* A [website](http://logic.baruchsites.com/home)
* A series of [video lectures/tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GnvXEJE2SQ&list=PLjjC8fkYUK5ajXuu2RtrPke3OE6KJGZiF)

The website contains a number of features for students:
* Online (ungraded) exercises to practice skills & concepts.
* Online homework assignments that are automatically graded by the website.
* Links to all of the course videos.
* A link to the textbook (in the About section)

There is also an **admin** section of the website [(http://logic.baruchsites.com/admin)](http://logic.baruchsites.com/admin), which is only accessible to course instructors. The admin section allows professors to view their students' grades on the homework assignments.


<h2>Mechanics of the Course</h2>

The course is a *hybrid course* - it is a mix of in-person and online learning. All of the materials are available online, and students will spend roughly half of the course sessions working independently on the course materials (outside of class time). The overall scheme is that the online materials are intended to be, in themselves, sufficient to cover all of the material in the course. Therefore, the in-person meetings may be thought of as review sessions and meetings intended to clarify and solidify the information in the online materials.

For this reason, we recommend that attendance *not* be counted towards a full grade for the course. If a student is able to master the material for the course without coming to the in-person review sessions, they ought to be able to receive an A. To repeat: *There is no formal requirement to come to class* (except for special circumstances or exams). Thus, on the recommended syllabus, the grade is entirely dependent on the homework score, the midterm, and the final exam. *However*, many students will *not* be able to master the material without attending in-class sessions, and some may not be sufficiently motivated to attend. Therefore, we recommend allowing 5-10% *extra credit* for those who come to the review sessions, ask & answer questions, and do proofs. This motivates students to attend the review sessions, and allows students who want to work hard for a good grade a chance to boost their grade.

In general, the course will meet *every other session*. Due to the irregularities of the CUNY schedule, that does *not* mean, for example, that you will meet every Monday, and skip every Wednesday.

**NOTE**: On the web interface, there is a circle next to the homework assignment link. To clarify, the circle becomes filled in if the student scores 100% on the assignment. There is no special significance to scoring 100, but some students found this visual indicator confusing, so that is what it does.



<h2>Textbook</h2>

The textbook is available as a Google doc: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Du0ACARlaeZqEhM6JdWHH0nffNSCYDAZ](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Du0ACARlaeZqEhM6JdWHH0nffNSCYDAZ)

It is divided into three units (see below).

The textbook is written in a somewhat conversational style. The intention was to explain the relevant concepts in simple and clear terms, appealing to commonsense explanations when appropriate and avoiding an overly formalized presentation.



<h2>Course Content</h2>

The course is divided into three units:

<h4>Unit 1</h4>

Unit I is intended to introduce students to the basic concepts of philosophical logic, and expose them to logical arguments in an informal (non-symbolic) setting.

Unit I covers:
* Introduction to logic
* Logical concepts (validity, soundness, strength, cogency, etc.)
* The structure of a logical argument
* Logical keywords (*hence*, *therefore*, etc.)
* Logical fallacies (informal)

<h4>Unit 2</h4>

Unit II introduces symbolic notation. Students learn how (and why) to translate from English into symbolic notation. We also introduce truth tables and cover the truth table method of proof.

Unit II covers:
* Symbolic logic translations
* Truth tables
* Using truth tables to determine validity of a symbolic argument


<h4>Unit 3</h4>

Unit III is about natural deduction proofs. Students will learn a number of rules for natural deduction and will get lots of practice in applying them. Finally, students will learn about conditional proof and proof by negation.

Unit III covers:
* Natural deduction
* Rules for natural deduction
* Advanced proof techniques (conditional proof; proof by negation)


<h2>Homework Exercises</h2>

Homework exercises are completed via the website. Students may attempt the homework as many times as they want before the due date (at which point their scores will no longer be saved). Their scores will be immediately calculated and displayed. Because of this, there is nothing preventing students from just guessing at the answers until they get a perfect score. However, as you may wish to remind the students, anyone who employs this approach to the homeworks will not succeed on the exams.

You may wish to stress that students should avoid the temptation to guess at or "game" the homeworks. However, due to the fact that one may continue to improve one's answers, one should expect that all or most of the students will complete all or most of the homeworks. Thus, homeworks are intended to be relatively "low-stakes," and are mainly crucial as preparation for the exams.

Homeworks will be due at the start of the next in-person class session (at which point the homework will be reviewed in class). For instance, if there is an in-person session on Monday, and then an online class on Wednesday, the homwork will be due at the start of the *following* in-person class (i.e., the next Monday). Students are free to consume the online materials and complete the homework at *any point* during that period - i.e., there is no expectation that students will do the online work exactly at "class time."

You may also note to the students that all of the problems that are given during the exams will be exactly like (in terms of content and format) the problems from the homework. Thus, "if you want to do well on the exams, work on the homeworks."

If a student has technical difficulties submitting the homework (the server returns an error, their score does not appear to be displaying, etc.), you may tell the student to print out or take a screenshot of the completed homework and you can give them credit manually.


<h2>Video Lectures</h2>

There are a series of videos to accompany the text and the exercises. Note that there is a fair amount of overlap between the content in the textbook and in the video. This is informed by the perspective that having the same information presented in a variety of formats will help solidify that information for students. The videos also expand on the information in the text with examples and additional commentary.

Again, due to the online nature of these materials, there is nothing *requiring* students to watch the videos *or* read the text. The idea is to provide the student with all the materials that they might need to do well on the exams, and it is up to **the student** to decide how to utilize these resources on their own. You may wish to stress the increased autonomy and self-responsibility that goes along with online/hybrid courses.


<h2>Exams</h2>

On the recommended format, there are two exams: a midterm (30% of the grade), and a final (20%). For various reasons, it is not possible to administer the exam via the web application. Therefore, exams are to be held in class. Sample exams will be available to professors. However, please note that it is *very likely* that the information in these exams will become publicly available to students if the same material is repeated. Therefore, we recommend switching up the questions to some extent each iteration of the course (and, ideally, each section).

The first exam will cover Units I (informal logic) and II (symbolic logic and truth tables) of the course. It is possible to give an exam with truth tables using multiple-choice. Therefore, it is possible to make the midterm entirely Scantron-based. Examples of how this can be done will be provided.

The final exam, however, will also include natural deduction. There is no way to do a natural deduction proof using a multiple-choice format. Therefore, at least some of the final exam will have to be graded by hand. That is potentially all of the manual grading that you will have to do for the course!


<h2>Setting up the course</h2>

<p>At the beginning of the semester, the administrator of the application ("The Admin") will create an entry in the database for each section of the course, identified by its Baruch course code. The Admin will also create an entry for each professor ("The Prof"). The Admin will assign The Prof a random key that will allow The Prof to access the admin section of the site (<a href="https://logic.baruchsites.com/admin">logic.baruchsites.com/admin</a>).</p>
<p>The Admin will create a random key (8-character alphanumeric string) for each student that is enrolled in any section of the course. Each Prof will send the Admin a copy of the roster for their class. The Admin will then assign a random key to each student. The mapping from student to key will be stored locally (not on the server). The Admin will then send the key assignments to The Prof (e.g., as a spreadsheet). The Prof will then distribute the keys to the students (manually on the first day of class, or using Blackboard messaging, or by email).</p>
<p>In order to comply with FERPA regulations, <b>no identifying student information will be stored on the server.</b> Therefore, students will be identified solely by their random keys. The key also allows the student to log in to the website and record their progress.<b>There is no additional registration process for the website.</b> Registration is entirely handled by The Admin.</p> This also means that there is no process for resetting a key that has been lost or forgotten.
<p>The Admin and The Prof will both retain a local copy of the key assignments. If a student forgets their key, they must ask The Prof for it. If The Prof loses the information, they must ask The Admin.</p>
<p>The Prof's key will allow The Prof to log in to the admin dashboard and view the progress and scores of each student. Initially, each student is identified only by their random key. However, The Prof may enter the students' actual names on the website - but this information will only be stored on The Prof's local cache (see below).</p>



<h2>The Website Admin Dashboard</h2>

The admin dashboard on the website is *extremely barebones*. For the time being, its sole purpose is to present to the instructor the student's homework scores. Instructors will be given an admin password. The first time you log in, you will see a table of random IDs. These are the ID strings associated with the students in your class. Due to the design of the application (in order to comply with student privacy regulations), we cannot initially display the names associated with the ID. *However*, there is a button at the top of the admin that says "Change Names." If you click this button, you will see an interface where you can enter the student's real name next to their ID. It is **highly recommended** that you do this at the beginning of the semseter, as it will make it much easier to track your students' progress.

However, please note that the names you enter are *not* stored on the server - they are stored on your local machine's memory. Therefore, they will not appear if you log in from a different computer, or if you entirely clear your cache (clear local storage).

It is crucial to maintain the original spreadsheet containing the mapping from unique IDs to names. For one reason, in case the student forgets their ID, the only way to recover it is by emailing the professor (or the admin, as a fallback).


<h2>Takeaways</h2>

Hybrid courses are very different than normal courses. And this one is even more so! Make sure to take the time to clearly explain to students what the course is, how it will work, and what is expected of them. Also, you may wish to acknowledge that the course may have some "bugs" or defects - there may occasionally be issues with submitting a homework, or accessing a video. Issues will be addressed quickly and in such a way that will not harm the student's grade. However, you may also want to highlight the benefits of using this curriculum:
* Students are free to spend as much or as little time as they deem fit on mastering the course content.
* There are a variety of resources and support mechanisms to help learn the content.
* All of the materials are **free of charge**. Don't be afraid to mention that the textbook previously used for this course currently sells on Amazon for $70.
* The materials have been specially crafted for Baruch students by Baruch educators.

Don't be afraid to stress the freedom offered by the class. But be sure to note that this requires a higher level of discispline and self-awareness than most classes. The instructor will not always be there asking you if you read this or that chapter, etc. Based on the course structure, you can literally come to class only two or three times and still receive a perfect score! But this happens very rarely. Students must take it upon themselves to work on the material during the week (not leave everything until the last night); not "game" or guess at the homework answers; and actually come to the in-person review sessions if they are not understanding the material. Ultimately, if a student is not doing well, and they are *not* attending the review sessions, then they are indicating that they are not motivated to perform better in the class. To put it in a positive way, the review sessions are extremely helpful and people who attend tend to get better grades.
