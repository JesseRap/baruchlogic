<h2>The online portal for PHI 1600 - Logic and Moral Reasoning</h2>

This is the code for the online course package for Philosophy 1600 at Baruch College. The curriculum was developed by Jesse Rappaport and Eric Mandelbaum at Baruch College.

The course features a free textbook, videos, exercises, and homework sections, as well as automated truth tables and natural deduction proof checkers (coming soon).

Currently, registration in the course is limited to active students in the class at Baruch college. However, visitors may enjoy all the videos and exercises, although their progress will not be tracked.

The application is written in raw PHP, using the MVC approach, although we are currently migrating it to the Laravel framework. The project follows the BEM methodology of CSS.
